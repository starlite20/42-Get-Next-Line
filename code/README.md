## Description
get_next_line is a project focused on creating the functionality to be able to read a line from a given file. This is done by reading through the file descriptor, one call at a time. The core of the project lies in managing the state between function calls through the use of a static variable.

The function returns the line extracted based on finding the terminating character. The terminating character are determined by newline character (\n), and  the end of the file. 

Additionally, the code must be handle different buffer sizes efficiently and also, be able to read from different file descriptors.
